# SpeakJS
A JS library for text to speech in Google Chrome. The overall code is in speakjs.js, the speaking is in speak.js, recognition is recognition.js, and language codes are in languages.js.

Sorry if your language is not in languages.js. There are a lot of languages and I only chose the ones that I've heard of to save time. there are 45 languages in it though...
